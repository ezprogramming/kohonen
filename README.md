## Demo Comparisons and Results

Here are the detailed results from each demonstration showing the key improvements:

### 1. Vectorization Improvement

The vectorization demo compares a naive triple-loop implementation with our fully vectorized approach:

- **Naive Implementation**: Uses traditional nested Python loops (3 loops) to process data and update weights
- **Vectorized Implementation**: Uses NumPy broadcasting and array operations to eliminate loops

**Key Results**:
- **Speed Improvement**: 30-50x faster training times, especially for larger grid sizes
- **Memory Efficiency**: The vectorized implementation uses memory more efficiently despite processing more data at once
- **Scalability**: Performance gains increase with grid size, with larger grids seeing greater benefits

This implementation completely eliminates the triple nested loops by using NumPy's broadcasting capabilities, resulting in dramatically faster training times without sacrificing accuracy.

### 2. Batch Processing for Memory Efficiency

The batch processing demo shows how we manage memory usage for large datasets:

![Batch Processing Memory Usage](examples/comparison/memory_profiles.png)
![Batch Comparison](examples/comparison/batch_comparison.png)

**Key Results**:
- **Memory Control**: Batch processing allows training on very large datasets with minimal memory overhead
- **Configurable Trade-off**: Users can select batch sizes to balance memory usage and performance
- **Automatic Adaptation**: The implementation automatically adjusts to handle datasets of any size

For production use with larger datasets, batch sizes between 500-1000 samples offer the best balance between memory usage and performance.

### 3. MLflow Integration for Experiment Tracking

The MLflow integration demo shows comprehensive experiment tracking and model management:

```

## Quick Start

### Basic SOM Usage

```python
import numpy as np
from kohonen import SelfOrganizingMap

# Create a SOM with configurable dimensions
# (these values can be customized via .env file when using Docker)
width, height = 50, 50  # Default project config is now 50x50 via .env
input_dim = 3
som = SelfOrganizingMap(width=width, height=height, input_dim=input_dim)

# Generate random training data
samples = 1000  # Configurable via SOM_SAMPLES in .env
data = np.random.rand(samples, input_dim)

# Train the SOM
iterations = 300  # Configurable via SOM_ITERATIONS in .env
# For smaller datasets, use fully vectorized approach (batch_size=None)
# For larger datasets, use batch processing to control memory usage
batch_size = None  # Set to a numeric value like 100 for large datasets
metrics = som.train(data, n_iterations=iterations, verbose=True, batch_size=batch_size)

# Get the trained weights
weights = som.get_weights()

# Find the Best Matching Unit (BMU) for a new data point
new_point = np.array([0.2, 0.5, 0.8])
bmu_x, bmu_y = som.predict_bmu(new_point)
print(f"BMU coordinates: ({bmu_x}, {bmu_y})")
```

### Memory-Efficient Training with Batch Processing

For large datasets, you can use batch processing to control memory usage:

```python
# For a dataset with 100,000 samples
large_data = np.random.rand(100000, input_dim)

# Use batch processing with a batch size of 500
# This reduces memory usage during training
metrics = som.train(large_data, n_iterations=iterations, verbose=True, batch_size=500)
```

### Visualization

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from kohonen.visualization import plot_som_grid, plot_component_planes

# Visualize the trained SOM
fig = plot_som_grid(weights)
plt.savefig("som_grid.png")

# Visualize component planes
component_names = ["Feature 1", "Feature 2", "Feature 3"]
fig = plot_component_planes(weights, component_names=component_names)
plt.savefig("component_planes.png")
```

### MLflow Integration

```python
from kohonen.mlflow_utils import log_som_model, load_som_model

# Log a trained model to MLflow
run_id = log_som_model(
    model=som,
    input_data=data,
    params={
        "width": width,
        "height": height, 
        "input_dim": input_dim,
        "iterations": iterations,
        "samples": samples
    },
    training_metrics=metrics,
    run_name="my_som_model",
    save_visualizations=True
)

# Later, load the model from MLflow
loaded_som = load_som_model(run_id)
```

#### Inspecting MLflow Experiments

You can inspect your MLflow experiments and runs using the provided `inspect_mlflow.py` script:

```python
# Inspect all experiments and runs
python -m kohonen.scripts.inspect_mlflow

# Inspect a specific run with detailed information
python -m kohonen.scripts.inspect_mlflow --run-id <run_id>

# Specify a custom MLflow data directory
python -m kohonen.scripts.inspect_mlflow --mlflow-dir path/to/mlflow_data
```

Or use the Makefile shortcut:

```bash
# Inspect all experiments
make inspect

# Inspect a specific run
make inspect run_id=<run_id>
```

This tool helps you understand your experiment structure, view run parameters, metrics, and artifacts without needing to use the MLflow UI.

### API Service

Start the API service:

```bash
uvicorn kohonen.api:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

Make predictions:

```python
import requests
import numpy as np

# Single prediction
response = requests.post(
    "http://localhost:8000/predict-bmu",
    json={"data": [0.2, 0.5, 0.8].tolist()}
)
print(response.json())  # {"bmu_x": 15, "bmu_y": 20}

# Batch prediction
response = requests.post(
    "http://localhost:8000/predict-batch",
    json={"data": np.random.rand(5, 3).tolist()}
)
print(response.json())  # {"results": [{"bmu_x": 10, "bmu_y": 15}, ...]}
```

### API Service with Model Selection

The API service can automatically select the best model based on metrics:

```bash
# Start API with automatic model selection (automatically starts MLflow if not running)
make api

# Start API with specific run ID (from command line)
python -m kohonen.scripts.api_script --run-id <run_id>

# Start API with custom metric selection
python -m kohonen.scripts.api_script --metric quantization_error --ascending

# Force using the best model even if a run ID is available
python -m kohonen.scripts.api_script --force-best
```

Make predictions:

```python
import requests
import numpy as np

# Get info about the selected model
response = requests.get("http://localhost:8000/model-info")
print(response.json())

# List available models
response = requests.get("http://localhost:8000/models?max_results=5")
print(response.json())

# Make a prediction
response = requests.post(
    "http://localhost:8000/predict-bmu",
    json={"data": [0.2, 0.5, 0.8]}
)
print(response.json())  # {"bmu_x": 15, "bmu_y": 20}
```

## Docker Deployment

The recommended way to deploy the SOM is using Docker Compose with an `.env` file for configuration.

### Using Docker Compose (Recommended)

1. Create a `.env` file in the project root or use the provided example:

```
# SOM Configuration
SOM_WIDTH=50
SOM_HEIGHT=50
SOM_INPUT_DIM=3
SOM_ITERATIONS=300
SOM_SAMPLES=1000
SOM_LEARNING_RATE=0.1
SOM_BATCH_SIZE=
SOM_SIGMA=
SOM_RANDOM_STATE=42
SOM_RUN_NAME=som_model
SOM_VERBOSE=true

# MLflow Configuration
MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI=http://mlflow:5000
RUN_ID_FILE=/app/mlflow_data/run_id.txt

# API Configuration
PORT=8000
SOM_RUN_ID_FILE=/app/mlflow_data/run_id.txt

# Model Selection Configuration
# Metric used to select the best model
SOM_METRIC_KEY=quantization_error
# True -> minimize, False -> maximize  
SOM_METRIC_ASCENDING=true
# Force using best model regardless of run ID (default false)
SOM_FORCE_BEST=false
```

2. Start the Docker services:

```bash
# Build the Docker images (required for first run or after code changes)
make build

# Start all services (MLflow, training, and API)
make up

# Access the MLflow UI at http://localhost:5050
# Access the API at http://localhost:8000
```

## Model Selection & Configuration

The API service can be configured to use either a specific model or automatically select the best model based on performance metrics.

### Understanding Model Selection

The model selection process follows these rules:

1. When `SOM_FORCE_BEST=true`:
   - The API will ignore run_id.txt and always select the best model based on metrics
   - The metric used for selection is defined by `SOM_METRIC_KEY` (default: quantization_error)
   - Whether to minimize or maximize the metric is set by `SOM_METRIC_ASCENDING` (default: true, meaning lower values are better)

2. When `SOM_FORCE_BEST=false` (default):
   - The API first checks for a run_id passed as a command-line argument
   - If no argument is provided, it reads the run_id from run_id.txt
   - If a valid run ID is found, it uses that specific model
   - If no valid run ID is found, it falls back to selecting the best model

### Training and Model Updates

When you run training, the system automatically:
1. Trains a new SOM model with the parameters in .env
2. Logs it to MLflow for tracking
3. Writes the new run ID to run_id.txt
4. The API service (if started after training) will use this newly trained model

### Configuring Model Selection

You can use these Makefile commands to manage model selection:

```bash
# Configure API to always use the best model (ignore run_id.txt)
make use-best

# Configure API to use a specific run ID
make use-specific run_id=YOUR_RUN_ID
```

Or modify environment variables directly:

```bash
# In .env file
SOM_FORCE_BEST=true    # Always use best model
SOM_FORCE_BEST=false   # Use run_id.txt if available
```

### Inspecting Available Models

To see available models:

```bash
# View all runs in MLflow
make inspect

# View details of a specific run
make inspect run_id=YOUR_RUN_ID

# Check which model the API is currently using
curl http://localhost:8000/model-info
```

### Retraining & Docker Rebuild Guidelines

For different types of changes:

1. **Code changes in src/kohonen/**: You need to rebuild the Docker image
    ```bash
    make build
    make up
    ```

2. **Changes to environment variables in docker-compose.yml or .env**: No rebuild needed, just restart
    ```bash
    make down
    make up
    ```

3. **To train a new model with current settings**:
    ```bash
    make train
    ```
    This will automatically write the new run ID to run_id.txt
